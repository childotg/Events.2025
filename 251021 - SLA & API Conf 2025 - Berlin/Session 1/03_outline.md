# Content Outline
Purpose: define the logical sequence and pacing of the talk.

## How to fill
- Limit to 5–7 main sections.
- Assign time and support materials.
- One idea per slide.

## Template
| # | Section | Objective | Time (min) | Support (slides/demo) | Transition note |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Opening & Context | Hook audience with core tension: impact beyond commit log. Establish speaker credibility (product + services experience). | 5 | Slides 1-4 (title, hook, context, pattern) | "Credibility is the currency that crosses both worlds" → introduce Lesson 1 |
| 2 | Lesson 1: Languages of Value | Show difference between product (speed, features) vs service (trust, reliability) organizations. Introduce translation as leadership skill. | 8 | Slides 5-16 (comparison, credibility, translation, Carl Rogers quote, practical example) | "Now that we understand translation, how do we maintain credibility while translating?" → Lesson 2 |
| 3 | Lesson 2: Staying Credible as IC | Contrast formal vs reputational power. Introduce "credibility battery" metaphor. Show micro-practices (PoCs, code reviews, shadowing). | 8 | Slides 17-22 (two kinds of power, reputation fades, Suzuki quote, humility, micro-practices) | "Credibility alone isn't enough—you need leverage" → Lesson 3 |
| 4 | Lesson 3: Small Wins as Strategic Leverage | Explain Trojan-horse PoC concept. Show practical examples (API bridge, dashboard, automation). Provide 4-step build guide. | 10 | Slides 23-31 (technical persuasion, small wins, reducing gap, Trojan-horse, committee approval, practical examples, common language, how to build) | "Three lessons covered—now let's apply them daily" → Application |
| 5 | Application & Framework | Synthesize three lessons into operational framework. Add empathic listening practice. Provide mental exercise. | 8 | Slides 32-38 (leadership goal, putting together, three steps, code as leadership, listen like PM, Batman quote, mental exercise) | "One final thought before closing" → Closing |
| 6 | Closing & Takeaway | Reinforce core message: stay technical to stay credible. Final quote with visual emphasis. | 4 | Slides 39-40 (closing message, final "stay technical to stay credible") | Open for Q&A |
| 7 | Q&A | Answer audience questions, provide clarifications, share additional examples if needed. | 7 | N/A (conversational) | Thank audience, share follow-up resources if available |

### Slide plan
- Estimated slide count: 40 slides
- Notes: one idea per slide, short titles, visual cues, no text duplication with speech.
- Slide types: Big quotes (hooks, key insights), comparison layouts (before/after), bullet points (micro-practices, frameworks), attribution quotes (Rogers, Suzuki, Greenleaf, Batman).
- Visual emphasis: Use `.emphasis` class for key words (credibility, translation, replicable trust, PoC, strategic leverage).
- Pacing: Slower on slides with big quotes (3-5 sec pause after reveal), faster on bullet lists, moderate on comparisons.

## Checklist
- [x] Total time fits slot (45 min: 38 min talk + 7 min Q&A)
- [x] Each section has a goal
- [x] Alternates talk/demo sections (no demos, but alternates concepts/examples/frameworks)
- [x] Transitions defined
