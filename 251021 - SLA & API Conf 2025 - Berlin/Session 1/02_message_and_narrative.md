# Message and Narrative
Purpose: define the key idea, takeaways, and story logic.

## How to fill
- Write one main message (max 20 words).
- Define 2–3 takeaways.
- Choose a narrative arc: Problem → Tension → Solution → Impact.
- Add evidence or stories supporting each takeaway.

## Template
- Core message: Technical leadership without formal authority requires staying hands-on to maintain replicable trust and strategic influence.

- Key takeaways:
  1. Understanding different languages of value: translate technical work into business outcomes (margins, predictability, time-to-market) to build bridges between engineering and strategy.
  2. Staying credible as an individual contributor: technical reputation is a battery—recharge it through micro-practices (quarterly PoCs, code reviews, shadowing teams).
  3. Using small wins as strategic leverage: concrete examples (Trojan-horse PoCs, dashboards, automation) speak louder than alignment slides and build trust across functions.

- Narrative structure:
  - Problem: As you climb the ladder, your impact no longer shows up in commit logs. You risk losing technical credibility while gaining formal authority—but in hybrid organizations (product + services), formal power matters less than tangible contribution.
  - Tension / Why now: Product and service organizations measure value differently (features vs trust, speed vs reliability). Without translation skills and visible technical contribution, leaders become isolated from both technical teams and business stakeholders. Credibility fades when you stop building.
  - Solution / Idea: Lead through replicable trust: stay hands-on with strategic micro-practices (PoCs, code reviews, shadowing). Translate technical work into business language. Use small, visible wins (Trojan-horse PoCs) to influence without authority. Practice empathic listening to define problems before proposing solutions.
  - Impact / Outcome: Technical leaders who stay hands-on build credibility that crosses organizational boundaries. They create common language between tech and business, influence strategy through concrete examples, and scale their impact by delegating—not abandoning—technical work. Ultimate goal: create new leaders, make yourself unnecessary.

- Supporting evidence (data, story, demo):
  - **P&L comparison**: Service company (35% gross margin, 10% EBITDA, people-based COGS) vs Product company (85% gross margin, 15% EBITDA, infrastructure COGS) shows concrete economic difference between business models—makes "translation" concept tangible and visual.
  - **Empathy research**: "Manifestations of Empathy in Software Engineering" shows empathy as act of listening, understanding use cases, mediating between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  - **Leadership humility**: Shunryu Suzuki's "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" on maintaining openness and beginner's mindset even as expert. Modern leadership integrates confidence with recognition of limits and openness to feedback.
  - **Servant leadership**: Robert Greenleaf's principle "Good leaders must first become good servants" frames leadership as service rather than imposition.
  - **Shared leadership**: Studies show distributed leadership improves performance, innovation, adaptability. In agile contexts, mature teams require "leadership gap"—delegation that creates space for autonomous initiative.
  - **Practical example from slides**: Refactoring authentication module ("technical debt reduction") → translated to business as "cut client onboarding from 3 days to 4 hours" (faster contract signing).
  - **Trojan-horse PoC examples**: Simple API bridging two isolated databases (later adopted by both teams); dashboard linking uptime/bugs to revenue/NPS (makes technical work visible to leadership); automation removing repetitive manual work (frees time across departments).
