# Delivery and Speaker Notes
Purpose: guide live delivery and timing.

## How to fill
- Use bullet points, not full sentences.
- Mark pauses, emphasis, and interactions.
- Include fallback options for demo or timing issues.

## Template

### Opening hook (prefer future or scenario form)
- **Slide 1-2**: Start with scenario question: "What happens when your impact no longer shows up in the commit log?"
- **PAUSE 3 seconds** after revealing hook
- Acknowledge audience mix: product engineers, service CTOs, tech leads
- Personal framing: "Past decade, both worlds—same pattern emerged"
- **Emphasis**: "commit log" (technical), "impact" (strategic)

### Key points by section

**Section 1: Opening & Context (slides 1-4)**
- Hook with commit log metaphor
- Frame pattern: higher you climb, further from code
- Credibility = universal currency
- **PAUSE** after "Credibility is the currency that crosses both worlds"
- Transition: "But how do you maintain it when languages differ?"

**Section 2: Lesson 1 - Languages of Value (slides 5-16)**
- Show product vs service comparison—don't read slide, let visual speak
- Introduce **replicable trust** concept (emphasize "replicable")
- Authority ≠ Power (formal vs earned)
- Translation example: refactoring → onboarding speed (reference slide, don't read)
- Carl Rogers quote: **PAUSE 2 seconds** before attribution
- Empathy = understanding, not agreement
- **Emphasis**: "building the bridge in their language"
- Servant leadership reference (Greenleaf)—light touch, no deep dive
- Transition: "Translation is necessary, but not sufficient"

**Section 3: Lesson 2 - Staying Credible as IC (slides 17-22)**
- Two kinds of power visual: formal (left, gray) vs reputational (right, blue)
- Battery metaphor: "technical credibility is a battery—recharge it in the field"
- Suzuki quote on beginner's mind: **PAUSE 2 seconds**, let it land
- Humility ≠ hiding skill; humility = using skill to understand others
- Micro-practices: enumerate slowly (one PoC per quarter / review code / shadow teams)
- **Emphasis**: "Small actions, sustained credibility"
- Transition: "Credibility maintained, but how to leverage it?"

**Section 4: Lesson 3 - Small Wins as Strategic Leverage (slides 23-31)**
- PoC as modern technical persuasion (proof speaks louder than slides)
- Small wins examples: script, dashboard, automation—pick one, expand briefly
- Trojan-horse PoC: mini-project, measurable impact, shows potential
- "You don't need committee approval" → **PAUSE**, let irony land
- Practical examples: bridging units, talking to board, reducing friction
- Each PoC = common language (show, don't explain)
- How to build: 4 steps (enumerate clearly, slightly slower pace)
- **Emphasis**: "Pick right problem / Limit scope / Measure impact / Frame as opportunity"
- Transition: "Three lessons—now daily application"

**Section 5: Application & Framework (slides 32-38)**
- Synthesize: credibility, translation, small examples
- Three steps to influence: show value, share language, build alliances
- Code as leadership tool (tie back to opening hook)
- Listen like a PM: define problem before solution
- **PAUSE** after "good listening defines problem space before solution space"
- Batman quote: light humor, connect to "needs" (not deserves)
- Mental exercise: "If tomorrow you could build one PoC..." → **invite silent reflection 5 seconds**
- Transition: "One final thought"

**Section 6: Closing & Takeaway (slides 39-40)**
- "Technical leadership isn't leaving code for strategy—bringing strategy into code"
- **PAUSE 3 seconds**
- Final slide: "Stay technical to stay credible" (big visual emphasis)
- **Let slide breathe 4 seconds** before transitioning to Q&A
- Thank audience, invite questions

### Audience interaction
- Questions to ask:
  - (Optional, if time) "How many here have moved from product to service org, or vice versa?" (show of hands, gauge audience)
  - During mental exercise (slide 38): "Think silently: what PoC would align two teams that never talk?"
- Demo moments: N/A (no live demos—slide-based visual storytelling only)

### Closing / Call to action
- Implement one micro-practice within next quarter
- Reflect on your "credibility battery" status
- Build one Trojan-horse PoC addressing cross-functional pain point
- (If materials available) Share link to slide deck or reading list

### Operational notes
- Timing per section:
  - Opening: 5 min (slides 1-4)
  - Lesson 1: 8 min (slides 5-16)
  - Lesson 2: 8 min (slides 17-22)
  - Lesson 3: 10 min (slides 23-31)
  - Application: 8 min (slides 32-38)
  - Closing: 4 min (slides 39-40)
  - Q&A: 7 min
  - **Total: 50 min** (5 min buffer for overrun)
- Planned pauses:
  - After opening hook (3 sec)
  - After credibility quote (2 sec)
  - After Carl Rogers quote (2 sec)
  - After Suzuki quote (2 sec)
  - After "you don't need committee approval" (2 sec)
  - After "define problem space before solution space" (2 sec)
  - Before mental exercise (invite 5 sec silent reflection)
  - After closing message (3 sec)
  - Final slide breathe (4 sec)
- Backup plan:
  - **If running over time**: skip slides 36-37 (Listen like PM, Batman quote), jump directly from slide 35 to 38 (mental exercise)
  - **If audience very engaged**: extend Q&A, offer to continue discussion after session
  - **If questions dry up early**: share additional PoC example from personal experience (keep 2-3 stories in reserve)
  - **If technical jargon confuses non-engineers**: use slide 16 (practical example) as anchor—return to concrete translation
- Follow-up materials:
  - Reading list: "Manifestations of Empathy in Software Engineering", John Hennessy "Leading Matters", Kouzes & Posner "The Leadership Challenge"
  - Optional: share slide deck via QR code or conference platform
  - Optional: LinkedIn post with key takeaways + invite to connect
