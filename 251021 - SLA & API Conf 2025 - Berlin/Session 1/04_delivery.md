# Delivery and Speaker Notes
Purpose: guide live delivery and timing.

## How to fill
- Use bullet points, not full sentences.
- Mark pauses, emphasis, and interactions.
- Include fallback options for demo or timing issues.

## Template

### Opening hook (prefer future or scenario form)
- **Slide 1-2**: Start with scenario question: "What happens when your impact no longer shows up in the commit log?"
- **PAUSE 3 seconds** after revealing hook
- Acknowledge audience mix: product engineers, service CTOs, tech leads
- Personal framing: "Past decade, both worlds—same pattern emerged"
- **Emphasis**: "commit log" (technical), "impact" (strategic)

### Key points by section

**Section 1: Opening & Context (slides 1-4)**
- Hook with commit log metaphor
- Frame pattern: higher you climb, further from code
- Credibility = universal currency
- **PAUSE** after "Credibility is the currency that crosses both worlds"
- Transition: "But how do you maintain it when languages differ?"

**Section 2: Lesson 1 - Languages of Value (slides 6-20)**
- Show product vs service comparison—don't read slide, let visual speak
- Introduce **replicable trust** concept (emphasize "replicable")
- Authority ≠ Power (formal vs earned)
- **P&L slides (13-15)**: Show concrete economic difference—Service (35% margin) vs Product (85% margin)—let tables speak, don't read numbers, emphasize "two different economic models"
- Translation example: refactoring → onboarding speed (reference slide, don't read)
- Empathy quote: **PAUSE 2 seconds** after quote (no attribution shown)
- Empathy = understanding, not agreement
- **Emphasis**: "building the bridge in their language"
- Servant leadership (Greenleaf): "Good leaders must first become good servants"—light touch, no deep dive
- Transition: "Translation is necessary, but not sufficient"

**Section 3: Lesson 2 - Staying Credible as IC (slides 21-26)**
- Two kinds of power visual: formal (given) vs reputational (earned)
- Suzuki quote on beginner's mind: **PAUSE 2 seconds**, let it land
- Humility ≠ hiding skill; humility = using skill to understand others (fragment reveals second part)
- Micro-practices: enumerate slowly (one PoC per quarter / review code / shadow teams)
- **Closing with battery metaphor**: "technical credibility is a battery—recharge it in the field"
- **Emphasis**: "Stop building, and your technical reputation fades fast"
- Transition: "Credibility maintained, but how to leverage it?"

**Section 4: Lesson 3 - Small Wins as Strategic Leverage (slides 27-34)**
- PoC as modern technical persuasion (proof speaks louder than slides)
- Small wins examples: script, dashboard, automation—pick one, expand briefly
- Trojan-horse PoC: mini-project, measurable impact, shows potential (not perfection)
- Practical examples: bridging units, talking to board, reducing friction
- Each PoC = common language (show, don't explain)
- How to build: 4 steps (enumerate clearly, slightly slower pace)
- **Emphasis**: "Pick right problem / Limit scope / Measure impact / Frame as opportunity"
- **Leadership goal closing**: "Create new leaders, make yourself unnecessary"
- Transition: "Three lessons—now daily application"

**Section 5: Application & Framework (slides 35-40)**
- **Slide 35 - Synthesize with fragments**: credibility, translation, small examples (each appears on click, followed by closing transition)
- Three steps to influence: show value, share language, build alliances
- Code as leadership tool (tie back to opening hook)
- Listen like a PM: define problem before solution
- **PAUSE** after "good listening defines problem space before solution space"
- Batman quote: light humor, connect to "needs" (not deserves)
- **Slide 40 - Provocative question**: "What's the smallest thing you could build this week that would make you harder to ignore?"
- **Fragment reveals circular callback**: "Your impact won't show up in the commit log anymore—but your credibility still can." (appears in 3 clicks: first part / second part / final tagline)
- **No silent reflection needed**—let audience absorb visually
- Transition: "One final thought"

**Section 6: Closing & Takeaway (slides 41-43)**
- **Slide 41**: "Technical leadership isn't choosing between code and strategy—it's using technical credibility to influence both"
- **PAUSE 3 seconds**—let core message land
- **Slide 42**: "Stay technical to stay credible" (big visual emphasis, final takeaway)
- **Let slide breathe 4 seconds** before transitioning to feedback slide
- **Slide 43**: Feedback image (close presentation)
- Thank audience, invite questions

### Audience interaction
- Questions to ask:
  - (Optional, if time) "How many here have moved from product to service org, or vice versa?" (show of hands, gauge audience)
- Demo moments: N/A (no live demos—slide-based visual storytelling only)

### Closing / Call to action
- Implement one micro-practice within next quarter
- Reflect on your "credibility battery" status
- Build one Trojan-horse PoC addressing cross-functional pain point
- (If materials available) Share link to slide deck or reading list

### Operational notes
- Planned pauses:
  - After opening hook (3 sec)
  - After credibility quote (2 sec)
  - After empathy quote (2 sec)
  - After Suzuki quote (2 sec)
  - After P&L slides (let tables speak, brief pause)
  - After "define problem space before solution space" (2 sec)
  - After closing message slide 41 (3 sec)
  - Final slide 42 breathe (4 sec)
- Backup plan:
  - **If running over time**: skip slides 38-39 (Listen like PM, Batman quote), jump directly from slide 37 to 40 (call to action)
  - **If audience very engaged**: extend Q&A, offer to continue discussion after session
  - **If questions dry up early**: share additional PoC example from personal experience (keep 2-3 stories in reserve)
  - **If technical jargon confuses non-engineers**: use P&L slides (13-15) or practical example (slide 20) as anchor—return to concrete translation
- Follow-up materials:
  - Reading list: "Manifestations of Empathy in Software Engineering", Shunryu Suzuki "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind", Robert Greenleaf "Servant Leadership"
  - Optional: share slide deck via QR code or conference platform
  - Optional: LinkedIn post with key takeaways + invite to connect
