**1. Introduction (5 minutes)**

**[Opening – 1 min]**
“In the past decade, I’ve worked in companies that build products and in companies that sell services. In both, I saw the same pattern: the higher you climb, the further you drift from the code—and the harder it becomes to know if your influence is real or just perceived.”

Short pause.

“This keynote comes from a personal question: can I drive strategy, inspire trust, and move an organization forward while staying a hands-on contributor? Over time, the answer became yes—but only if you remain *credible in the field*.”

---

**[Context – 2 min]**
Describe the contrast:

* In **product organizations**, impact is measured in shipped features, active users, speed of iteration.
* In **service organizations**, impact is measured in client trust, process scalability, and reputation.

“When you move from one to the other, you realize that technical leadership isn’t about frameworks or buzzwords—it’s about *replicable trust*: people seeing what you can actually do, not just hearing what you say you can do.”

Underline: *“Credibility is the currency that crosses both worlds.”*

---

**[Transition – 1 min]**
“In many technical leadership roles, authority is mistaken for power—titles, headcount, or budget. But in today’s hybrid world, where product and service teams overlap, formal power matters less than tangible contribution.”

Quick example:
“One line of code that unblocks a cross-functional team builds more trust than three alignment slides.”

---

**[Section close – 1 min]**
“This talk is about how to keep that *practical credibility* as you grow in influence—and how to use it to shape strategy and culture. The first lesson: never stop doing what made you credible in the first place. Writing code doesn’t reduce your authority—it anchors it to reality.”

---

**2. Lessons Learned (10 minutes)**

**[Introduction – 1 min]**
“Moving between product and service models teaches you that technical leadership principles don’t change—but the context does. The key is knowing which behaviors sustain trust regardless of business model.”

---

**[Lesson 1: Understanding different languages of value – 3 min]**

* In product work: value = innovation and speed.
* In service work: value = reliability and client confidence.

"As engineers, we tend to measure everything in performance or code elegance. But the business measures trust, margins, and predictability. Understanding the other side's language of value makes you far more influential. You don't have to abandon the technical language—you have to translate it."

**Show P&L comparison (slides 13-15):**
"Look at the economics: a service company operates with 35% gross margin and 10% EBITDA—selling people with markup. A product company? 85% gross margin, 15% EBITDA—building value that scales. Two completely different economic models. Understanding this shapes how you communicate."

> "Empathy is not agreement; it's understanding."

"For technologists, empathy isn't asking the business to understand our systems. It's building the bridge in their language—even when they don't speak ours. It's an act of humility, not submission. The most effective contributor translates without expecting reciprocity."

Connect to *Servant Leadership* (Robert Greenleaf): "Good leaders must first become good servants."

Example: a refactoring that cuts client onboarding time → clear business message: *less time to sign new contracts.*

---

**[Lesson 2: Staying credible as an individual contributor – 3 min]**
“In every organization there are two kinds of power: formal and reputational. The first comes from the title; the second from example. Stop building, and your technical reputation fades fast.”

> “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.” — *Shunryu Suzuki*

“Humility doesn’t mean hiding your skill—it means using it to understand others better. It’s the antidote to technical arrogance: it’s not about having the last word, it’s about asking the right first question. Humility keeps curiosity alive.”

Micro-practices:

* Build one PoC per quarter.
* Review code on strategic projects.
* Shadow teams that don’t report to you.

“Technical credibility is a battery—it drains if you don’t recharge it in the field.”

---

**[Lesson 3: Using small wins as strategic leverage – 3 min]**
“The best way to influence without authority is through concrete examples that speak for themselves. Proof-of-concepts are the modern form of technical persuasion.”

Example:

* A small script that links two internal systems.
* A shared dashboard connecting technical and business metrics.

“Each visible result reduces the gap between those who decide and those who deliver.”

---

**[Section close – 1 min]**
“True technical leadership isn’t about control—it’s about connection: between code and outcomes, between teams and clients, between different languages of value. Empathy, listening, and humility aren’t soft skills—they’re hard skills for anyone who wants to stay influential.”

**3. Using Small Wins as Strategic Leverage (10 minutes)**

**[Introduction – 1 min]**
"The best way to influence without authority is through concrete examples that speak for themselves. Proof-of-concepts are the modern form of technical persuasion."

---

**[Small Wins in Action – 2 min]**

Examples of strategic leverage:

* A small script that links two internal systems.
* A shared dashboard connecting technical and business metrics.
* An automation that removes repetitive manual work.

"Start small, prove value, scale impact."

---

**[The Trojan-horse PoC – 2 min]**

What makes a PoC effective:

* A mini-project solving a real, visible problem.
* Measurable impact, minimal cost.
* Built to show potential, not perfection.

---

**[Practical examples – 3 min]**

1. **Bridging business units:** a simple API connecting two isolated databases, later adopted by both teams.
2. **Talking with the board:** a dashboard linking uptime or bug data to revenue and NPS.
3. **Reducing internal friction:** an automation script that removes repetitive manual work across departments.

"Each PoC becomes a common language. It doesn't explain—it *shows*. It's the most credible form of strategy."

---

**[How to build it – 3 min]**
Operational framework:

1. **Pick the right problem:** one that affects two functions and has a natural sponsor.
2. **Limit the scope:** one week of work max.
3. **Measure the impact:** show before and after.
4. **Frame it as opportunity, not challenge.**

"A good PoC isn't about technology. It's about collaboration, efficiency, and trust."

**Leadership goal:**
"Create new leaders, make yourself unnecessary."

---

**[Section close – 1 min]**
"When a PoC enters cultural production—not just technical—you've built something that changes how the organization thinks. That's when technical skill becomes strategic leverage."

---

**4. Practical Application and Takeaways (5 minutes)**

**[Introduction – 1 min]**
“So far, we’ve covered three ideas: maintaining credibility, translating the language of value, and using small examples to influence strategy. Let’s close with how to apply these daily.”

---

**[Operational framework – 2 min]**
Three steps to influence without authority:

1. **Show concrete value** – use data, outcomes, visible PoCs.
2. **Share a technical-strategic language** – connect uptime to margins, latency to customer experience.
3. **Build alliances through delivery** – don’t persuade, collaborate.

“Every technical action should echo in the language of business. That’s how code becomes a leadership tool.”

Connect to **product-style listening:**
“A good technical leader listens like a product manager: define the problem before proposing the solution. Listening isn’t compliance—it’s exploration of the problem space before the solution space. Each right question saves a week of wrong coding.”

> “He’s the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.” — *Batman, Christopher Nolan*

“As technical leaders, we’re often what the company doesn’t think it deserves—but what it needs. The one who listens, translates, and builds bridges—even when no one asked for it.”

---

**[Call to Action – 1 min]**
Ask the provocative question (slide 40):
"What's the smallest thing you could build this week that would make you harder to ignore?"

Let it land, then reveal the circular callback:

> "Your impact won't show up in the commit log anymore—but your credibility still can."

**Final tagline:** "One PoC. One week. Visible value."

---

**[Closing – 1 min]**
"Technical leadership isn't choosing between code and strategy—it's using technical credibility to influence both."

End with the key line (slide 42):
**"Stay technical to stay credible."**
