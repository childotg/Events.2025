# Talk Identity

- Subtitle (optional): Lessons from a CTO's Journey from Product to Services
- Duration (minutes): 45
- Language: English
- Event / context: SLA & API Conf 2025 - Berlin
- Objective (1 measurable outcome): Enable attendees to identify 2-3 concrete micro-practices to maintain technical credibility while operating in strategic roles
- Primary audience (role, seniority): Senior engineers, tech leads, engineering managers, CTOs transitioning between product and service companies
- Prerequisites / assumed knowledge: Experience in technical leadership roles; familiarity with product development and/or professional services contexts
- Talk type (spoken / hands-on / demo / mixed / panel): Spoken presentation with visual storytelling
- Constraints (room, tech, timing, etc.): Standard conference room, projector with 16:9 aspect ratio, no live demos required, 40 slides total
- Expected post-talk action: Attendees implement at least one "micro-practice" (PoC, code review, shadowing) within one quarter; attendees reflect on their own "credibility battery" status
