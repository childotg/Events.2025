# Talk Script
Purpose: Write the complete talk narrative before creating slides.

## How to fill
- Write the talk as you would deliver it
- Use natural language, not bullet points
- Include all quotes, examples, transitions
- Mark timing for each section
- Identify key moments (pauses, emphasis, audience interaction)

## Why this matters
Writing the full talk BEFORE slides ensures:
- Message clarity and natural flow
- All transitions are smooth
- Quotes and examples are well-integrated
- Timing is realistic
- Slides serve the talk (not the other way around)

## Template

**Section 1: [Title from 03_outline.md] ([X] minutes)**

**[Sub-section 1 – [Y] min]**
<!-- TODO: Write opening lines -->
"..."

<!-- TODO: Mark any pauses or emphasis -->
Short pause.

<!-- TODO: Continue narrative with natural transitions -->
"..."

> <!-- TODO: Add any quotes in blockquote format -->
> "Quote text here" — *Attribution*

<!-- TODO: Describe any examples or stories -->
"Example: ..."

---

**[Sub-section 2 – [Y] min]**
<!-- TODO: Continue with next part of this section -->
"..."

<!-- TODO: Include transitions to next sub-section -->
"..."

---

**[Section close – [Y] min]**
<!-- TODO: Wrap up this section -->
"..."

<!-- TODO: Set up transition to next major section -->
"This leads us to..."

---

**Section 2: [Title from 03_outline.md] ([X] minutes)**

<!-- TODO: Repeat structure for all sections from 03_outline.md -->

## Guidelines

### Opening Hook
- Start strong with scenario, question, or provocative statement
- Pause after hook to let it land (2-3 seconds)
- Avoid meta-talk ("Today I'm going to...")
- Make it relevant to audience's pain points

### Body Sections
- One clear idea per sub-section
- Use concrete examples (not abstract concepts)
- Transition between sub-sections explicitly
- Vary pacing (fast/slow, serious/light)

### Quotes
- Verify attribution accuracy before finalizing
- Pause before AND after quote (let it breathe)
- Connect quote to your message (don't drop it cold)

### Examples/Stories
- Keep them short (1-2 minutes max)
- Make the point obvious (don't make audience work to connect)
- Use specific details (not generic scenarios)

### Audience Interaction
- Plan questions that invite reflection, not just yes/no
- Give time for people to think (5-10 seconds silence is OK)
- Don't force interaction if energy is low

### Closing
- Circle back to opening hook (create closure)
- Summarize key takeaways (max 3)
- End with clear call to action (within 7 days)
- Avoid thanking audience multiple times

## Timing Checks

Use this table to validate your timing:

| Section | Planned Time | Actual Word Count | Est. Speaking Time* |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Opening | <!-- TODO --> min | <!-- TODO --> words | <!-- TODO --> min |
| Section 1 | <!-- TODO --> min | <!-- TODO --> words | <!-- TODO --> min |
| Section 2 | <!-- TODO --> min | <!-- TODO --> words | <!-- TODO --> min |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Closing | <!-- TODO --> min | <!-- TODO --> words | <!-- TODO --> min |
| **Total** | **<!-- TODO --> min** | **<!-- TODO --> words** | **<!-- TODO --> min** |

*Rule of thumb: ~150 words per minute for natural speaking pace (slower for emphasis, faster for examples)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Write in bullet points (this should read like a script)
- Skip transitions ("Now let's talk about X")
- Assume audience knows context (explain acronyms, concepts)
- Over-explain technical details (use analogies)
- Rush the ending (save buffer time)

✅ **Do:**
- Write how you actually speak (contractions, natural rhythm)
- Mark pauses explicitly (they're easy to forget when nervous)
- Read it aloud and time yourself
- Test examples on a non-expert friend
- Leave 5-10% buffer for audience questions/reactions

## Validation Checklist

Before moving to slide creation:

- [ ] Total time matches slot from 01_identity.md
- [ ] All sections from 03_outline.md are covered
- [ ] Opening hook is strong and relevant
- [ ] Transitions between sections are smooth
- [ ] All quotes have accurate attributions
- [ ] Examples are concrete and relatable
- [ ] Closing circles back to opening
- [ ] Call to action is clear and actionable within 7 days
- [ ] Read aloud test completed (timed)
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
