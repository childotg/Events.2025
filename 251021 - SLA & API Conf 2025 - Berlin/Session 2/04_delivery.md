# Delivery and Speaker Notes
Purpose: guide live delivery and timing.

## How to fill
- Use bullet points, not full sentences.
- Mark pauses, emphasis, and interactions.
- Include fallback options for demo or timing issues.

## Template
### Opening hook (prefer future or scenario form)
- "Imagine your first platform success creates a template you can't escape"
- "What if the 'right' decision today becomes the wrong constraint tomorrow?"
- PAUSE 2 seconds - let it land

### Key points by section
1. **Opening + Context** (5 min)
   - Auth platform: deployed, working, teams happy
   - Pattern established: centralized control = success
   - Storage next logical step
   - Show quick auth metrics if available

2. **The Build Decision** (6 min)
   - Make vs Buy framework applied
   - Make wins: acquire competence + maintain control
   - MinIO chosen: open source, S3-compatible
   - Initial deploy smooth

3. **The Plateau** (8 min) - CORE SECTION
   - Month 3: performance issues surface
   - Hidden requirements emerge (compliance, backup strategies, multi-region)
   - Team stretched thin on operations vs innovation
   - PAUSE: "We built it right. But right for what?"

4. **The Buy Phase** (7 min)
   - Vendor selection without panic
   - Key constraint: zero downtime migration
   - Managed service transition
   - Business continuity maintained

5. **The Learning Year** (6 min)
   - Team reorganizes: less ops, more governance
   - Hidden requirements now visible
   - Focus shifts: tech control → business needs discovery
   - "Governance scales, code doesn't"

6. **The Rebuild** (4 min)
   - Return to internal with clarity
   - Definitive characteristics defined by production experience
   - Not failure → informed iteration

7. **Lessons + CTA** (4 min)
   - Takeaway 1: Low exit costs > perfect decisions
   - Takeaway 2: Governance = business discovery
   - Takeaway 3: Iteration reveals truth
   - CTA: Identify one platform decision to treat as experiment

### Audience interaction
- Questions to ask: "Who's faced a platform decision that felt permanent?" (show of hands at Section 3)
- Demo moments: Show before/after architecture diagram (Section 4-5 transition)

### Closing / Call to action
- "This week: identify one platform choice you can make reversible"
- "Test your assumptions with low switching costs"
- "Iteration isn't indecision—it's strategic learning"

### Operational notes
- Timing per section: 5/6/8/7/6/4/4 minutes (40 min total + 5 min buffer)
- Planned pauses: After opening hook (2s), after "right for what?" (3s), before CTA (2s)
- Backup plan: If running long, compress Section 1 to 3 min (auth story is setup, not core)
- Follow-up materials: Framework diagram for make/buy/iterate decisions (can share as PDF or GitHub link)
