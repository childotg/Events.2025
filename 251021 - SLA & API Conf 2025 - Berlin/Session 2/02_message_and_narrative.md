# Message and Narrative
Purpose: define the key idea, takeaways, and story logic.

## How to fill
- Write one main message (max 20 words).
- Define 2–3 takeaways.
- Choose a narrative arc: Problem → Tension → Solution → Impact.
- Add evidence or stories supporting each takeaway.

## Template
- Core message: Iteration between build, buy, and managed services reveals strategic clarity better than trying to decide correctly upfront
- Key takeaways:
  1. Short-term decisions with low exit costs enable learning faster than long-term "correct" choices
  2. Platform governance should prioritize business needs discovery, not just technology control
  3. Rebuilding after buying isn't failure—it's informed iteration with real requirements
- Narrative structure:
  - Problem: Multiple development teams have common needs (auth, storage), but decisions feel permanent and high-stakes
  - Tension / Why now: First platform success (auth) creates pressure to replicate, but storage reveals complexity when "build for control" plateaus after 3 months
  - Solution / Idea: Treat platform decisions as iterative experiments—build to learn, buy to sustain, rebuild with clarity
  - Impact / Outcome: Team reorganizes with deep understanding of hidden requirements and business governance (not just tech)
- **Opening hook explanation**: The opening hook ("Imagine your first platform success creates a template you can't escape") establishes cognitive constraint as the core tension. It's NOT anti-pattern or anti-success—it's about the trap of applying a proven solution (centralized auth) to a different problem (storage) without questioning context fit. The "template" becomes a prison when success creates the assumption that the same approach will always work. This sets up the MinIO story: auth centralization succeeded, so storage centralization seemed obvious—until production revealed the mismatch.
- Supporting evidence (data, story, demo): MinIO case study showing 3-month operational phase revealing problems, vendor selection process, 1-year managed service period, and final rebuild with definitive characteristics. Includes concrete example of transitioning to managed vendor without compromising business continuity. Demonstrates how hidden requirements only surface through production experience.
