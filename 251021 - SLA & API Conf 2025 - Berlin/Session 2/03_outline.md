- One idea per slide.

## Template
| # | Section | Objective | Time (min) | Support (slides/demo) | Transition note |

| 1 | Opening + Context | Hook audience and set the stage with auth success story | 5 | 3-4 slides | "Auth worked. So we thought storage would be easy..." |

### Slide plan
- Estimated slide count: 27-34 slides (average 1.5 minutes per slide)
- Notes: one idea per slide, short titles, visual cues, no text duplication with speech. Section 3 (The Plateau) is the narrative heart with technical/operational depth. Section 4 emphasizes business continuity during transition. Section 5 focuses on business governance vs tech governance.
