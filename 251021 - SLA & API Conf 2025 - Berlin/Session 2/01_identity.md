# Talk Identity
Purpose: define the context, constraints, and target audience.

## How to fill
- Use measurable and specific values.
- Indicate one primary audience.
- Choose one talk type (spoken, hands-on, mixed, panel).

## Template
- Title: Platform Engineering Beyond Build-vs-Buy: The MinIO Case Study
- Subtitle (optional): Learning to adapt through iteration, not perfection
- Duration (minutes): 45
- Event / context: SLA & API Conf 2025 - Berlin
- Objective (1 measurable outcome): Enable attendees to evaluate one use case in their organization where they can test short-term platform decisions with low exit costs, prioritizing adaptation over immediate long-term correctness
- Primary audience (role, seniority): Platform engineers, DevOps engineers, engineering managers, tech leads (mixed seniority: mid to senior)
- Prerequisites / assumed knowledge: None required. Basic concepts (DevOps, stateless/stateful, object storage) will be introduced during the talk
- Talk type (spoken / hands-on / demo / mixed / panel): Spoken with case study narrative and visual diagrams
- Constraints (room, tech, timing, etc.): 45-minute slot including Q&A buffer (aim for 38-40 min content), standard conference room with projector, no live demos required
- Expected post-talk action: Within 7 days, identify and evaluate one platform decision in their current work that can be approached iteratively (with low switching costs) rather than as a permanent choice
